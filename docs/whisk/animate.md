# Whisk Animate

Whisk Animate is an extension of the core Whisk platform that enables users to transform their generated still images into short videos, adding movement and life to their creations.

## Key Features

## Technical Implementation

Whisk Animate leverages Veo 2, Google's specialized video generation model that can:

- Infer natural motion from still images
- Maintain the visual style and quality of the original image
- Create short but compelling animated sequences

## Use Cases

Whisk Animate is particularly valuable for:

- Bringing character designs to life with subtle animations
- Creating animated social media content
- Developing short animated sequences for presentations or websites

As with the core Whisk platform, Whisk Animate represents Google's approach to making creative AI tools more accessible by focusing on visual inputs rather than complex prompting, extending this philosophy from still images to motion.
