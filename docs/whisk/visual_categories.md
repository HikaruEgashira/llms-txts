# Visual Categories in Whisk

Whisk organizes the image generation process around three primary visual categories, each representing a different aspect of the visual creation process.

## Subject

The Subject category focuses on the main characters, people, or objects that will appear in the generated image. Examples might include:

- Characters with specific characteristics
- Animals
- Objects that serve as the focal point of the composition
- People with particular features or attributes

Whisk allows users to upload reference images to define the subjects they want to include in their generations. These subject references help the system understand what main elements should appear in the final image.

## Scene

The Scene category addresses the environment, setting, or background in which the subjects exist. This can include:

- Natural landscapes
- Urban environments
- Fantasy settings
- Abstract spaces
- Architectural interiors or exteriors

Scene references help establish the world or context in which the subject is placed, defining the spatial and environmental aspects of the image.

## Style

The Style category governs the artistic approach, visual treatment, and aesthetic quality of the generated images. This can include:

- Artistic styles (impressionist, cubist, etc.)
- Medium (oil painting, watercolor, digital art, etc.)
- Rendering techniques (photorealistic, cartoon, etc.)
- Visual mood or tone (dreamy, gritty, vibrant, etc.)

Style references are particularly powerful in Whisk, as they allow users to quickly apply distinctive visual treatments to their compositions without needing to describe these qualities in words.

## Mixing Categories

One of Whisk's strengths is its ability to accept references across these categories and intelligently combine them. Users can:

- Upload multiple images for the same category to blend characteristics
- Mix and match references across categories to create unique combinations
- Iterate by replacing individual category references while keeping others constant

This categorical approach provides structure to the creative process while maintaining flexibility, making visual ideation more intuitive and exploration-friendly.
