# User Experience in Whisk

Whisk was designed with a focus on creating an intuitive, visual-first experience that eliminates the need for prompt engineering while enabling powerful creative exploration.

## Core User Flow

1. **Reference Image Selection**: Users begin by uploading or selecting images that will serve as references for subjects, scenes, and styles.

2. **Generation**: With reference images in place, users can trigger image generation to produce new compositions that blend elements from their selected references.

3. **Iteration**: Users can refine their results by replacing or adjusting reference images, regenerating, and exploring variations.

## Interface Design Principles

Whisk's interface follows several key design principles:

- **Visual Primacy**: The interface prioritizes visual elements over text, with large image thumbnails and minimal text entry.

- **Category-Based Organization**: The clear separation of subject, scene, and style makes the creative process more structured and understandable.

- **Rapid Iteration**: The system is optimized for quick experimentation, with streamlined workflows for trying multiple combinations.

- **Accessibility**: By removing the barrier of prompt engineering, Whisk makes advanced image generation accessible to a broader audience.

## Collaborative Aspects

Whisk is designed to feel collaborative, similar to working with a creative partner:

- The system responds to visual inputs rather than requiring precise textual instructions
- Generation results often contain creative interpretations that can inspire further exploration
- The back-and-forth process of reference and generation creates a dialogue-like creative flow

## Target Use Cases

Whisk is particularly well-suited for:

- Turning rough sketches or concepts into more polished visualizations
- Exploring visual styles for creative projects
- Creating customized illustrations for personal or professional use
- Visualizing ideas without advanced artistic skills
- Transforming physical artwork into digital variations

By focusing on these user-centered design principles, Whisk creates an experience that feels more like a creative collaboration than a technical tool, making advanced AI image generation accessible to users regardless of their technical background.
