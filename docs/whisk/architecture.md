# Architecture of Whisk

Whisk's architecture integrates multiple advanced AI systems and a thoughtfully designed user interface to create a streamlined image generation experience.

## Core Components

### 1. Frontend Interface

The user-facing interface provides:
- Reference image upload capabilities
- Visual category organization (Subject, Scene, Style)
- Generation controls and results display
- Iteration and refinement options

### 2. Multimodal Analysis Pipeline

When users upload reference images, the system employs:
- **Gemini Model**: Analyzes visual content and generates detailed text descriptions
- **Image Processing**: Prepares and normalizes reference images for analysis
- **Feature Extraction**: Identifies key visual elements across categories

### 3. Generation Backend

The core generation system includes:
- **Imagen 3**: Google's advanced text-to-image model that converts descriptions into images
- **Parameter Management**: Controls aspects like generation strength, diversity, and fidelity
- **Queue Management**: Handles concurrent generation requests

### 4. Animation Pipeline (Whisk Animate)

For users with Google One AI Premium:
- **Veo 2 Integration**: Connects to Google's video generation model
- **Animation Parameters**: Manages the conversion of still images to short videos
- **Quota Management**: Tracks and enforces usage limits

## Technical Integration

Whisk represents a sophisticated integration of:

1. **Multimodal AI**: Combining visual analysis (understanding reference images) with text-to-image generation
2. **Model Orchestration**: Coordinating multiple AI models to create a seamless experience
3. **User-Centered Design**: Abstracting technical complexity behind an intuitive interface

## Deployment Architecture

While specific deployment details are not publicly documented, Whisk likely employs:
- Cloud-based infrastructure for scalable processing
- API interfaces between components
- Real-time processing for interactive feedback
- Asynchronous processing for computationally intensive tasks

## Data Flow

The typical data flow through the Whisk architecture follows this pattern:

1. User uploads reference images â†’ Frontend
2. Frontend categorizes images by type (Subject/Scene/Style)
3. Gemini analyzes images and generates detailed descriptions
4. Descriptions are passed to Imagen 3 for image synthesis
5. Generated images are returned to the frontend for display
6. (Optional) Selected images may be sent to Veo 2 for animation

This architecture enables the seemingly simple user experience of Whisk while leveraging multiple sophisticated AI models behind the scenes.
