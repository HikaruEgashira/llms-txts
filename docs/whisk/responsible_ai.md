# Responsible AI in Whisk

As with all of Google's AI products, Whisk incorporates responsible AI principles and practices designed to promote safety, fairness, and ethical use of the technology.

## Content Policies

Whisk implements several content-related safeguards:

- **Prohibited Content**: The system prevents generation of harmful, explicit, violent, or otherwise inappropriate content
- **Reference Image Screening**: Uploaded reference images are screened for policy violations
- **Output Filtering**: Generated images are evaluated against safety criteria before being shown to users
- **User Guidelines**: Clear policies outline acceptable use of the platform

## Bias Mitigation

Steps taken to address potential biases include:

- **Training Data Curation**: Efforts to ensure diverse and representative training data for the underlying models
- **Ongoing Evaluation**: Continuous testing and refinement to identify and address emergent biases
- **Transparency About Limitations**: Clear communication about the system's current capabilities and constraints

## Attribution and Intellectual Property

Whisk addresses creative ownership considerations through:

- **Terms of Service**: Clear terms regarding the ownership of generated content
- **Transparency**: Information about how reference images inform the generation process
- **User Control**: Giving users agency over how their uploaded content is used

## User Education

The platform promotes responsible use through:

- **Help Documentation**: Resources explaining capabilities, limitations, and best practices
- **UI Design**: Interface elements that guide users toward appropriate use cases
- **Feedback Mechanisms**: Channels for users to report concerns or issues

## Technical Safeguards

Behind the scenes, Whisk employs various technical approaches to responsible AI:

- **Model Fine-tuning**: Techniques to reduce harmful outputs from the underlying models
- **Multi-stage Filtering**: Multiple checkpoints to evaluate content for policy compliance
- **Human Review**: Processes for human evaluation of edge cases and system improvements

## Ongoing Development

Google's approach to responsible AI in Whisk includes:

- **Iterative Improvement**: Continuous refinement based on user feedback and emerging challenges
- **Research Integration**: Incorporation of latest research on fairness, accountability, and transparency
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Working with diverse communities to understand impacts and concerns

## Transparency and Documentation

Whisk provides transparency about:

- **System Capabilities**: Clear documentation about what the system can and cannot do
- **Model Information**: General information about the underlying models and technologies
- **Limitations**: Explicit acknowledgment of current limitations and challenges

These responsible AI practices reflect Google's commitment to developing AI systems that are innovative while also being aligned with human values and societal benefit.
