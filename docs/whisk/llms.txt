# Whisk

> Whisk is Google Labs' visual ideation tool that allows users to create images by combining and remixing visual elements without needing to master prompt engineering. Built on Google's Imagen 3 model, Whisk enables fast visual experimentation through an intuitive interface.

Whisk represents Google's approach to democratizing image creation by making the process more intuitive and accessible. Users can upload reference images that serve as guidance for subject, scene, and style, which the system then uses to generate new images that capture their essence.
