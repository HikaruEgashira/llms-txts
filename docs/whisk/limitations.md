# Limitations of Whisk

While Whisk provides an innovative approach to image generation, it has several current limitations that users should be aware of.

## Technical Limitations

### Reference Image Interpretation

- **Inconsistent Feature Extraction**: The system may not always correctly identify the intended features from reference images
- **Complex Visual Concepts**: Certain complex visual ideas may be difficult to communicate through reference images alone
- **Limited Control Over Specific Details**: Users cannot directly specify which aspects of reference images should be emphasized

### Generation Capabilities

- **Fixed Output Resolution**: Generated images have standardized dimensions without options for customization
- **Style Consistency**: Some artistic styles may be more challenging for the system to accurately reproduce
- **Text Rendering**: Like many image generation systems, Whisk may struggle with accurate text rendering in images

## Usability Constraints

### Interface Limitations

- **Limited Reference Images**: The system supports only a small number of reference images per generation
- **Categorical Constraints**: The rigid Subject/Scene/Style framework may not accommodate all creative concepts
- **Limited History**: The system has limited capabilities for tracking generation history or saving preferences

### Availability and Access

- **Geographic Restrictions**: The service may not be available in all regions
- **Dependency on Google Account**: Requires Google account authentication
- **Premium Features**: Whisk Animate requires a Google One AI Premium subscription

## Content Restrictions

- **Content Policy Enforcement**: Generated images must comply with Google's content policies
- **Restricted Subjects**: Certain types of content cannot be generated due to safety and ethical considerations
- **Copyright Considerations**: Questions around the copyright status of generated images when based on reference materials

## Technical Performance

- **Generation Time**: Image generation may take significant time, especially during periods of high demand
- **Service Stability**: As an experimental service, it may experience occasional downtime or performance issues
- **Mobile Performance**: The interface may have limitations when used on mobile devices

## Conceptual Limitations

- **Creative Control**: The abstract nature of the reference-based system may limit precise creative control compared to systems with direct parameter adjustment
- **Reproducibility**: Exact reproduction of previous results may be difficult due to the probabilistic nature of the generation process
- **Iteration Granularity**: Limited ability to make small, targeted adjustments to specific aspects of generated images

Understanding these limitations helps users set appropriate expectations and develop effective strategies for working within the current capabilities of the Whisk platform.
