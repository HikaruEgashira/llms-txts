# Agno-AGI

> Agno-AGI is a lightweight library for building Multimodal AI Agents with memory, knowledge, and tools. It exposes Large Language Models (LLMs) as a unified API, giving them capabilities like memory, knowledge retrieval, tool usage, and reasoning.

Agno (ἁγνὸ, meaning "pure" in Greek) is designed to be simple, fast, and model-agnostic. It allows developers to build lightning-fast Agents that can work with text, images, audio, and video. The framework enables the creation of AI agents at different levels of sophistication, from basic inference tasks to teams of specialized agents collaborating on complex workflows.

Key features include:
- Lightning-fast performance (10,000x faster agent creation than alternatives)
- Model-agnostic approach supporting any LLM provider
- Multimodal capabilities supporting text, image, audio, and video
- Memory management for persistent agent state
- Knowledge stores for domain-specific information
- Tool integration for enhanced agent capabilities
- Multi-agent architecture for complex workflows
