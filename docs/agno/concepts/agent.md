# Agent

An Agent in Agno-AGI is an intelligent program designed to solve problems autonomously. It represents the fundamental building block of the Agno framework.

## Definition

Agents in Agno-AGI are defined as computational entities that:
- Process inputs (text, images, audio, or video)
- Access external tools and information sources
- Make decisions based on reasoning
- Produce outputs (text, images, audio, or video)

Rather than using a rigid binary definition, Agno-AGI conceptualizes agents in terms of increasing levels of agency and autonomy:

- **Level 0**: Basic inference agents with no tools (simple query-response)
- **Level 1**: Agents with tools for autonomous task execution
- **Level 2**: Agents with knowledge, combining memory and reasoning capabilities
- **Level 3**: Teams of specialized agents collaborating on complex workflows

## Core Structure

A basic Agno-AGI agent consists of:

1. **Model**: The underlying LLM that powers the agent's reasoning
2. **Description**: A brief description of the agent's purpose and behavior
3. **Tools** (optional): External tools the agent can use
4. **Knowledge** (optional): Domain-specific information sources
5. **Memory** (optional): Persistent storage of past interactions
6. **Instructions** (optional): Specific directives for the agent's behavior

## Key Capabilities

Agno-AGI agents can:

- Process and generate multimodal content (text, images, audio, video)
- Use tools to interact with external systems
- Access knowledge from vector databases
- Maintain memory across sessions
- Collaborate in multi-agent teams
- Structure outputs in specific formats

## Implementation

The basic implementation of an Agno-AGI agent requires:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    description="You are an enthusiastic assistant!",
    markdown=true
)

agent.print_response("Hello, what can you do?", stream=true)
```

More sophisticated agents can incorporate tools, knowledge bases, and memory:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools
from agno.knowledge.pdf_url import PDFUrlKnowledgeBase
from agno.vectordb.lancedb import LanceDb

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    description="You are a research assistant!",
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
    knowledge=PDFUrlKnowledgeBase(...),
    show_tool_calls=true,
    markdown=true
)
```

## Design Philosophy

Agno-AGI's agent design philosophy emphasizes:

1. **Simplicity**: Pure Python implementation without complex abstractions
2. **Performance**: Minimal overhead for agent creation and execution
3. **Flexibility**: Support for multiple modalities and models
4. **Modularity**: Easy addition of tools, knowledge, and memory components
5. **Transparency**: Clear visibility into agent reasoning and actions
