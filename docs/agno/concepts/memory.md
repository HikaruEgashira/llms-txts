# Memory

Memory in Agno-AGI refers to the agent's ability to retain and recall information across interactions. Memory enables agents to maintain context, remember user preferences, and build on previous conversations, creating more coherent and personalized interactions.

## Core Concept

Memory systems in Agno-AGI allow agents to:
- Persist conversation history between interactions
- Store user-specific information and preferences
- Maintain session state across multiple turns
- Create and access summarized information from past interactions

Unlike the limited context window of underlying LLMs, Agno-AGI's memory systems can maintain information over extended periods and sessions, enabling long-term knowledge retention.

## Memory Types

Agno-AGI supports several types of memory:

1. **Conversation Memory**: Records the history of interactions between user and agent
2. **Session Memory**: Maintains state within a specific interaction session
3. **User Memory**: Stores user-specific information across multiple sessions
4. **Summarized Memory**: Condensed representations of longer conversations
5. **Selective Memory**: Filtered storage of only important information

## Implementation

Memory in Agno-AGI can be implemented through various storage backends:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.storage.redis import RedisStorage
from agno.memory.conversation import ConversationMemory

# Create a storage backend
storage = RedisStorage(
    redis_url="redis://localhost:6379/0",
    namespace="agent-memory"
)

# Create an agent with memory
agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    description="You are a helpful assistant with memory",
    storage=storage,
    memory=ConversationMemory(),  # Use conversation memory
    session_id="user-123"  # Identify the user session
)

# Memory persists across multiple interactions
agent.print_response("My name is Alice")
agent.print_response("What's my name?")  # Agent will remember "Alice"
```

## Memory Architectures

Agno-AGI supports different memory architectures:

1. **Simple Memory**: Direct storage of conversation turns
2. **Hierarchical Memory**: Organizing memory into different levels (recent, important, summary)
3. **Associative Memory**: Storing information with semantic relationships
4. **Vector Memory**: Using embeddings to enable semantic search of past interactions

## Storage Backends

Memory data can be stored in various backends:

- **In-Memory**: Temporary storage within the application
- **File System**: Persistent storage in local files
- **Redis**: Fast key-value storage
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database storage
- **MongoDB**: Document-based storage
- **Custom Storage**: Developer-defined storage mechanisms

## Memory Optimization

Techniques for optimizing memory in Agno-AGI:

1. **Summarization**: Creating condensed representations of longer conversations
2. **Pruning**: Removing less relevant or older information
3. **Chunking**: Breaking large memory blocks into manageable pieces
4. **Prioritization**: Giving precedence to more important information
5. **Compression**: Reducing the size of stored information

## Design Considerations

When implementing memory in Agno-AGI:

1. **Privacy**: Proper handling of user data and compliance with regulations
2. **Scalability**: Ensuring memory systems work efficiently at scale
3. **Relevance**: Storing only information that will be useful later
4. **Integration**: Seamless incorporation of memory into agent reasoning
5. **Cost**: Balancing memory depth with context window limitations and storage costs
