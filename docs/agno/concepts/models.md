# Models

Models in Agno-AGI refer to the language models that power agent reasoning and response generation. The framework is designed to be model-agnostic, supporting a wide range of providers and model types.

## Core Concept

Agno-AGI abstracts away the differences between various LLM providers, offering a unified API that allows developers to switch between models without changing their application code. This model-agnostic approach prevents vendor lock-in and enables flexibility in model selection based on specific use cases.

## Supported Model Types

Agno-AGI supports various types of models:

1. **Text Generation Models**: Process text inputs and generate text outputs
2. **Multimodal Models**: Process and/or generate multiple modalities (text, images, audio, video)
3. **Embedding Models**: Generate vector representations of content for knowledge retrieval

## Model Providers

Agno-AGI integrates with multiple model providers, including:

- **OpenAI**: GPT-4o, GPT-4, GPT-3.5-Turbo
- **Anthropic**: Claude 3 family (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku)
- **Google**: Gemini models
- **Mistral AI**: Mistral models
- **Local Models**: Support for running models locally with frameworks like Ollama
- **Custom Models**: API for integrating custom or proprietary models

## Implementation

Model integration in Agno-AGI follows a consistent pattern:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

# Using OpenAI
agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    description="You are a helpful assistant",
)

# Using Anthropic
from agno.models.anthropic import AnthropicChat
agent = Agent(
    model=AnthropicChat(id="claude-3-opus-20240229"),
    description="You are a helpful assistant",
)

# Using Google
from agno.models.google import GoogleChat
agent = Agent(
    model=GoogleChat(id="gemini-1.5-pro"),
    description="You are a helpful assistant",
)
```

## Model Parameters

Common parameters for configuring models in Agno-AGI:

- **id**: The specific model identifier
- **temperature**: Controls randomness in model responses (0.0-1.0)
- **max_tokens**: Maximum output token count
- **timeout**: Maximum time to wait for model response
- **api_key**: Authentication key (often set via environment variable)

## Multimodal Capabilities

Models in Agno-AGI can handle multimodal inputs and outputs:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    description="You are a visual assistant",
)

# Agent can process image inputs
image_path = "path/to/image.jpg"
agent.print_response({"text": "What's in this image?", "images": [image_path]})

# Agent can generate image outputs (with appropriate tools)
agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    tools=[DallEImageGeneration()],
    description="You can generate images",
)
```

## Model Selection Considerations

When selecting models in Agno-AGI, consider:

1. **Capability Requirements**: Different models excel at different tasks
2. **Performance Needs**: Response time, throughput, and resource usage
3. **Cost Implications**: Price per token varies significantly between models
4. **Context Window**: Maximum context length varies by model
5. **Multimodal Support**: Not all models support all modalities
