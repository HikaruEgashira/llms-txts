# Multi-agent Teams

Multi-agent teams in Agno-AGI represent collections of specialized agents working together to solve complex problems. This approach distributes cognitive load across multiple agents, each focused on specific aspects of a task, enabling more sophisticated and effective problem-solving.

## Core Concept

Multi-agent teams in Agno-AGI are designed to:
- Break down complex problems into manageable sub-tasks
- Distribute specialized knowledge and tools among different agents
- Enable parallel processing of different aspects of a problem
- Create systems with emergent capabilities beyond individual agents

Teams are organized with a coordinator agent that orchestrates the activities of member agents, delegating tasks and synthesizing results.

## Team Architecture

The standard architecture for Agno-AGI teams includes:

1. **Coordinator Agent**: Manages the team, distributes tasks, and synthesizes results
2. **Specialist Agents**: Focus on specific domains or functions
3. **Communication Protocols**: Methods for agents to share information
4. **Task Distribution Mechanisms**: Patterns for dividing work
5. **Result Synthesis**: Methods for combining individual contributions

## Implementation

Creating a multi-agent team in Agno-AGI follows this pattern:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools
from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools
from agno.team import Team

# Create specialist agents
web_agent = Agent(
    name="Web Agent",
    role="Search the web for information",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
    instructions="Always include sources",
    show_tool_calls=true,
    markdown=true,
)

finance_agent = Agent(
    name="Finance Agent",
    role="Get financial data",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    tools=[YFinanceTools(stock_price=true, analyst_recommendations=true)],
    instructions="Use tables to display data",
    show_tool_calls=true,
    markdown=true,
)

# Create a coordinator agent with team members
agent_team = Agent(
    mode="coordinate",  # Operating in coordination mode
    members=[web_agent, finance_agent],  # Team members
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    success_criteria="A comprehensive report with clear sections and data-driven insights.",
    instructions=["Always include sources", "Use tables to display data"],
    show_tool_calls=true,
    markdown=true,
)

# Use the team to solve a complex problem
agent_team.print_response("What's the market outlook for AI semiconductor companies?", stream=true)
```

## Team Patterns

Agno-AGI supports several team interaction patterns:

1. **Hierarchical**: Coordinator delegates to specialists in a tree structure
2. **Peer-to-Peer**: Agents communicate directly with each other
3. **Pipeline**: Output from one agent becomes input to another
4. **Hybrid**: Combinations of different patterns for complex workflows

## Team Composition

Effective team composition in Agno-AGI considers:

1. **Skill Complementarity**: Ensuring agents have complementary capabilities
2. **Tool Distribution**: Allocating tools to the most appropriate agents
3. **Model Selection**: Choosing appropriate models for different roles
4. **Knowledge Allocation**: Distributing domain knowledge among agents
5. **Role Definition**: Clearly defining each agent's responsibilities

## Advanced Team Capabilities

Multi-agent teams in Agno-AGI can implement advanced capabilities:

1. **Deliberation**: Multiple agents debating to reach better conclusions
2. **Iterative Refinement**: Progressive improvement of solutions
3. **Self-Critique**: Having agents review and critique each other's work
4. **Dynamic Team Formation**: Adjusting team composition based on the task
5. **Meta-Cognition**: Reflecting on team performance and adapting strategies

## Design Considerations

When implementing multi-agent teams in Agno-AGI:

1. **Communication Overhead**: Balancing collaboration with efficiency
2. **Coherence**: Ensuring consistent outputs across multiple agents
3. **Error Propagation**: Preventing errors from cascading through the team
4. **Cost Management**: Controlling the costs of multiple model invocations
5. **Complexity Management**: Keeping the system understandable and maintainable
