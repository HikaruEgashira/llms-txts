# Knowledge

Knowledge in Agno-AGI refers to domain-specific information that an agent can access to provide more accurate, relevant, and specialized responses. Unlike memory (which stores interaction history), knowledge bases contain external information that enhances an agent's capabilities within specific domains.

## Core Concept

Knowledge systems in Agno-AGI enable agents to:
- Access domain-specific information not present in their training data
- Reference authoritative sources for specialized questions
- Provide up-to-date information on specific topics
- Support responses with citations and evidence

Agno-AGI implements knowledge primarily through vector databases that enable semantic retrieval of relevant information based on the user's query.

## Knowledge Types

Agno-AGI supports various types of knowledge structures:

1. **Document-based Knowledge**: Information extracted from documents (PDFs, web pages, etc.)
2. **Structured Knowledge**: Information in databases or structured formats
3. **API-based Knowledge**: Real-time information accessed through APIs
4. **Multi-modal Knowledge**: Information in various formats (text, images, etc.)

## Implementation

Implementing knowledge in Agno-AGI typically involves:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.embedder.openai import OpenAIEmbedder
from agno.knowledge.pdf_url import PDFUrlKnowledgeBase
from agno.vectordb.lancedb import LanceDb, SearchType

# Create a knowledge base from PDFs
knowledge = PDFUrlKnowledgeBase(
    urls=["https://example.com/document.pdf"],  # Source documents
    vector_db=LanceDb(
        uri="tmp/lancedb",  # Storage location
        table_name="documents",  # Table name
        search_type=SearchType.hybrid,  # Search method
        embedder=OpenAIEmbedder(id="text-embedding-3-small"),  # Embedding model
    ),
)

# Create an agent with knowledge
agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    description="You are a domain expert",
    knowledge=knowledge,  # Attach knowledge base
    instructions=[
        "Search your knowledge base for relevant information",
        "Cite sources when providing information"
    ],
    markdown=true
)

# Load the knowledge base (usually done once)
if agent.knowledge is not null:
    agent.knowledge.load()

# Query the agent with domain-specific questions
agent.print_response("Tell me about the specific topic in the document", stream=true)
```

## Retrieval Methods

Agno-AGI supports several retrieval methods for knowledge:

1. **Semantic Search**: Finding information based on meaning rather than keywords
2. **Hybrid Search**: Combining semantic and keyword-based search
3. **Metadata Filtering**: Narrowing results based on document metadata
4. **Contextual Retrieval**: Adjusting search based on conversation context
5. **Agentic RAG**: Agent actively determines what information to retrieve

## Vector Databases

Agno-AGI integrates with multiple vector database solutions:

- **LanceDb**: Lightweight vector database
- **Chroma**: Open-source embedding database
- **Pinecone**: Managed vector database service
- **Weaviate**: Knowledge graph with vector search
- **Qdrant**: Vector database for similarity search
- **Custom Implementations**: Framework for custom vector stores

## Knowledge Base Creation

The process of creating knowledge bases in Agno-AGI:

1. **Content Collection**: Gathering relevant documents and information
2. **Processing**: Converting documents to text, extracting content
3. **Chunking**: Breaking content into appropriate segments
4. **Embedding**: Converting text chunks to vector representations
5. **Indexing**: Storing embeddings in a vector database
6. **Retrieval Testing**: Evaluating the quality of retrieved information

## Design Considerations

When implementing knowledge in Agno-AGI:

1. **Chunking Strategy**: Optimal segment size and overlap
2. **Freshness**: Keeping information updated
3. **Authority**: Ensuring information comes from reliable sources
4. **Integration**: Seamlessly incorporating retrieved information into responses
5. **Cost Efficiency**: Balancing embedding and storage costs
