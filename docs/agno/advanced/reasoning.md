# Advanced Reasoning Techniques

This document explores advanced reasoning techniques in Agno-AGI that enhance agent decision-making, problem-solving, and information processing capabilities. These techniques allow agents to tackle more complex tasks with greater accuracy and reliability.

## Core Reasoning Approaches

Agno-AGI incorporates several reasoning approaches:

### Chain-of-Thought Reasoning

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enables agents to break down complex problems into sequential steps:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.reasoning.cot import ChainOfThoughtReasoning

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    description="You are a problem-solving assistant.",
    reasoning=ChainOfThoughtReasoning(),
    instructions=[
        "Break down complex problems into steps.",
        "Show your work step-by-step.",
        "Verify your answers before finalizing."
    ],
    markdown=true
)

agent.print_response("What is 17 Ã— 24 and how would you calculate it manually?", stream=true)
```

This approach is particularly effective for:
- Mathematical calculations
- Logical deductions
- Multi-step problem solving
- Algorithm development

### Tree-of-Thought Reasoning

Tree-of-Thought (ToT) reasoning allows agents to explore multiple solution paths in parallel:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.reasoning.tot import TreeOfThoughtReasoning

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    description="You are a creative problem-solver.",
    reasoning=TreeOfThoughtReasoning(
        branches=3,  # Number of solution paths to explore
        depth=2      # Depth of exploration
    ),
    instructions=[
        "Consider multiple approaches to each problem.",
        "Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.",
        "Select the most promising solution path."
    ],
    markdown=true
)

agent.print_response("Design a system to reduce food waste in restaurants.", stream=true)
```

This approach excels in:
- Creative problem-solving
- Decision-making with multiple variables
- Situations with unclear optimal paths
- Strategic planning

### Agentic Reasoning

Agentic reasoning enables more autonomous decision-making:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.reasoning.agentic import AgenticReasoning
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    description="You are a research analyst.",
    reasoning=AgenticReasoning(
        goal_oriented=true,  # Focus on achieving specific goals
        reflective=true      # Include reflection on decisions
    ),
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
    instructions=[
        "Determine what information you need to solve the problem.",
        "Actively seek out required information.",
        "Reflect on the quality of your findings.",
        "Adjust your approach based on feedback."
    ],
    show_tool_calls=true,
    markdown=true
)

agent.print_response("Analyze the trends in renewable energy adoption over the past decade.", stream=true)
```

This approach is valuable for:
- Complex research tasks
- Autonomous information gathering
- Adaptive problem-solving
- Tasks requiring judgment and discretion

## Advanced Implementation Patterns

### Multi-Stage Reasoning

Break complex reasoning into distinct stages:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.reasoning.multistage import MultiStageReasoning

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    description="You are a strategic consultant.",
    reasoning=MultiStageReasoning(
        stages=[
            "problem_definition",
            "information_gathering",
            "analysis",
            "solution_development",
            "evaluation"
        ]
    ),
    markdown=true
)

agent.print_response("Develop a market entry strategy for a sustainable fashion brand in a competitive market.", stream=true)
```

### Deliberative Reasoning

Implement self-critique and iterative refinement:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.reasoning.deliberative import DeliberativeReasoning

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    description="You are a careful and thorough analyst.",
    reasoning=DeliberativeReasoning(
        iterations=3,         # Number of refinement cycles
        critique_strength=0.8  # How critical the self-review should be
    ),
    markdown=true
)

agent.print_response("Evaluate the ethical implications of using AI in hiring decisions.", stream=true)
```

### Ensemble Reasoning

Combine multiple reasoning approaches:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.reasoning.ensemble import EnsembleReasoning
from agno.reasoning.cot import ChainOfThoughtReasoning
from agno.reasoning.tot import TreeOfThoughtReasoning

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    description="You are a comprehensive problem-solver.",
    reasoning=EnsembleReasoning(
        approaches=[
            ChainOfThoughtReasoning(),
            TreeOfThoughtReasoning(branches=2, depth=2)
        ],
        integration_method="voting"  # How to combine results
    ),
    markdown=true
)

agent.print_response("Solve this logic puzzle: Three people each have either a black or white hat. They can see others' hats but not their own. If at least one person has a black hat, how can they determine their own hat color?", stream=true)
```

## Domain-Specific Reasoning

### Mathematical Reasoning

Specialized reasoning for mathematical problems:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.reasoning.mathematical import MathematicalReasoning
from agno.tools.python_repl import PythonREPLTools

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    description="You are a mathematical problem-solver.",
    reasoning=MathematicalReasoning(
        verification=true,  # Double-check results
        symbolic=true       # Use symbolic reasoning when appropriate
    ),
    tools=[PythonREPLTools()],
    markdown=true
)

agent.print_response("Find all values of x that satisfy the equation: x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = 0", stream=true)
```

### Scientific Reasoning

Reasoning specialized for scientific inquiry:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.reasoning.scientific import ScientificReasoning
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    description="You are a scientific researcher.",
    reasoning=ScientificReasoning(
        hypothesis_testing=true,  # Formulate and test hypotheses
        evidence_based=true       # Rely on evidence for conclusions
    ),
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
    markdown=true
)

agent.print_response("Explain why quantum entanglement doesn't allow faster-than-light communication.", stream=true)
```
